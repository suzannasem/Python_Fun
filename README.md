# Fun Python Projects

Selected Python Projects from Harvard's CS50 Course, updated regularly!

* _fuel.py_ : models a fuel gauge. user inputs a fraction and program returns a percentage, E (empty) or F(full). error for negative, non-integer inputs, or fractions > 1.
* _coke.py_ : models a Coca-Cola vending machine. Prompts user to insert coins (only quarters, dimes, and nickels accepted!) until user has inputted 50 cents. Any amount above this is returned as change.
* _plated.py_ : user inputs a potential vanity plate and program returns "Valid" or "Invalid" based on MA state guidelines (and there are a LOT so this is fun!!)
